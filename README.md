CoffeeScript in Action
======================

Source code for the Manning book [CoffeeScript in Action](http://manning.com/lee/).

Chapter listings will be available here after chapters are released to MEAP.

The code here is all in camelCase whereas existing MEAP chapters will have underscores.

If you find the camelCase hard to read, something like [Glasses Mode](http://emacswiki.org/emacs/GlassesMode) for emacs might help.# coffeescript-in-action
